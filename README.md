# ML Refresher: Comparing R and Python Workflows

A side-by-side comparison of machine learning workflows using R's tidymodels and Python's scikit-learn ecosystems.

## Overview

You would think for as many stats classes I took, this would be 2nd nature. It's not 🙃

This project serves two goals:
1. Refresh my modeling skills using tidymodels (which actually makes sense to my brain)
2. Practice Python by replicating a workflow I understand in R

## Dataset

Using the [Music & Mental Health Survey Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results) from Kaggle to predict anxiety scores from music listening habits.

## What's Inside

- VERY BASIC Exploratory data analysis comparing anxiety across demographics
- Simple ML workflow in both R (tidymodels) and Python (scikit-learn)
- Side-by-side syntax comparison for common modeling tasks

## Tech Stack

**R**: tidymodels, tidyverse, ggplot2  
**Python**: scikit-learn, polars, plotnine

## Status

🚧 Work in progress - because learning takes time and toddlers don't sleep
